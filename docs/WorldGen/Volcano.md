# Volcano

A volcano is a world structure. 

They can vary in size and shape. Some volcanoes are slim and tall, while others may be quite low and wide.
The max radius a single volcano can occupy is 200 blocks.

At the top of the volcano, you may find two different scenarios:
 
* Inactive volcano: The volcano still has to erupt. It is safe to walk on top of it. For now ...

* Active volcano: The volcano has unleashed it's fury, lava is spilling down the sides.

All volcanoes will have a lava channel running trough their center. At the bottom of the channel, you may find a well that varies in size. Some volcanoes may have a seamingly endless supply of lava, while others may run dry after a couple of hours.

However, volcanoes are not all but deadly. Some may contain precious loot.
