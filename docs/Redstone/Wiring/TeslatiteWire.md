#### Colours

Infused Teslatite Wire comes in all 16 different colours and with an unshielded version.

The principle behind the colours is to make compact wiring possible without interconnections between differently coloured wires.
An unshielded piece of Infused Teslatite wire can connect to any coloured/shielded piece of Infused Teslatite Wire. Yet a coloured wire will only connect to similarly coloured wires.

Infused Teslatite Wire can be placed on any face of a full block or the outside of a MicroPart.
It is not possible to place Infused Teslatite Wire on the inside of a MicroPart.

#### Redstone

The signal within a Infused Teslatite wire can have 2 values: 0 and 255. Meaning that an Infused Teslatite Wire is used for a digital signal. Either on or off.

Unlike Redstone Dust, Infused Teslatite Wire does now know any signal degradation over its length. Meaning that this type of wire is loss-less.

Shielded Infused Teslatite Wire can not transmit a redstone signal trough a block. Unshielded Infused Teslatite Wire can however.
